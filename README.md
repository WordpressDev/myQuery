myQuery is a miniature JavaScript DOM manipulation library, modelled around the jQuery API. It's written as a proof-of-concept for education purposes so that developers wishing to learn about JavaScript fundamentals like:

<ul>
<li>chaining</li>
<li>style manipulation</li>
<li>attribute manipulation</li>
<li>event handling</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>

can grasp these concepts without needing to go too beyond the JavaScript they may already be familiar with.
