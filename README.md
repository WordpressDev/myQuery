myQuery is a miniature JavaScript DOM manipulation library, modelled around the jQuery API. It's written as a proof-of-concept for education purposes so that developers wishing to learn about JavaScript fundamentals like:

-chaining
-style manipulation
-attribute manipulation
-event handling
-and more

can grasp these concepts without needing to go too beyond the JavaScript they may already be familiar with.
